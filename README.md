WORK IN PROGRESS --

## V1 build for the OC-OCR Wordpress theme.
(lightweight theme, built on the minimal '_s' framework

**Goal :**

Create a super lightweight theme that allowed users to sign up as members - be able to admin and edit their own personal page - and create blog posts sharing race reviews, trail reviews, gear reviews, etc.

Each member would have their own profile page with images, info and their blog content filtered to them specifically. Post content would then fill out general category pages.


**Roadblocks :**
shoulder surgery, Covid... lol.  Need to get back to V2.


**Completed :**
 - Custom User Fields for adding personal content and images
 - Athlete personal page template
 - Athlete List, dynamically ordered by amount of posts published
 - Trail Run Review Custom Post Type (ACF fields for template info)
 - Events CPT - and sorted list dynamically updated to remove when dates past
 
 
**V2 - To-Do :**
 - Public Membership sign-up & intake form
 - Athlete Page edit template for members
 - Ad sections  (value-add design, non-intrusive)
 - new Social media plugin
 - Trail/Run filter (by distance, type, elevation)
